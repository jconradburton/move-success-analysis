# Movie Social Network Attributes as Predictors of Box Office Success
The topic of predicting the success of a movie based on certain features has been a subject of interest for decades. These features range from social media and sentiment analysis to individual behavior analysis to even cinema arrangements. This study looks at a new subset of features to consider: the attributes of the social network of the characters in the movie. This analysis indicates that there is indeed an effect of a film's social network attributes on the level of success the movie experiences both financially and critically, introducing a possible new aspect of consideration in the widely researched domain of movie success prediction. 

The code for this study was written in the following three .ipynb files:

1. Social_network_attributes_dataset: extraction of social network attributes from the Movie Dynamics dataset at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/michaelfire/movie-dynamics-over-15000-movie-social-networks
